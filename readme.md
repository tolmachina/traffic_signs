# Predicting Traffic Signs

I've started with a CNN lookin like this:
![NN](NN.png)

Total Params = 610,000

It shows good accuracy ~0.946. But i do think that something is wrong.
I build prediction.py that makes predictions on test images and it is completly off.
I got best probabilities around 0.06.
